## From Prompts to Agents: Building & Evaluating R + LLM Workflows

:::::: columns

### Description

This hands-on workshop is a fast-track for R users who are new to generative AI. We'll start with reliable prompting patterns in R, then add more context, tool calls, and agentic orchestration to automate multi-step tasks. Along the way we'll cover tokens & context windows, prompt engineering best practices, model differences, safety basics, testing/QA, and lightweight testing/QC suitable for regulated pharma environments. Demos will feature packages such as ellmer and btw, alongside a small set of generic utilities for HTTP calls, validation, and logging (final package choices may vary). All code and slides will be open-sourced. Participants leave with runnable R scripts that covers a simple agentic workflow plus an evaluation pipeline they can adapt to their teams.

### Target Audience & Prerequisites

R analysts/scientists/engineers comfortable with data frames and basic scripting. No prior ML/AI required.

### Date & Time

Thursday, November 13, 2025  
3:00 PM - 5:00 PM Eastern (2 hours)
