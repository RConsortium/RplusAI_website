This is a dangerous combination, especially for data analysis and scientific research, where correctness and reproducibility are core requirements. Fortunately, it turns out that by carefully applying LLMs to narrower use cases, we can turn them into surprisingly reliable assistants that accelerate and enhance, rather than undermine, scientific work. This is not just theory—I’ll showcase working examples of seamlessly integrating LLMs into analytic workflows, helping data scientists build interactive, intelligent applications without needing to be web developers. You’ll see firsthand how keeping LLMs focused lets us leverage their “intelligence” in a way that’s practical, rigorous, and reproducible."

    "text": "From Prompts to Agents: Building & Evaluating R + LLM Workflows\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis hands-on workshop is a fast-track for R users who are new to generative AI. We’ll start with reliable prompting patterns in R, then add more context, tool calls, and agentic orchestration to automate multi-step tasks. Along the way we’ll cover tokens & context windows, prompt engineering best practices, model differences, safety basics, testing/QA, and lightweight testing/QC suitable for regulated pharma environments. Demos will feature packages such as ellmer and btw, alongside a small set of generic utilities for HTTP calls, validation, and logging (final package choices may vary). All code and slides will be open-sourced. Participants leave with runnable R scripts that covers a simple agentic workflow plus an evaluation pipeline they can adapt to their teams.\n\n\nTarget Audience & Prerequisites\nR analysts/scientists/engineers comfortable with data frames and basic scripting. No prior ML/AI required.\n\n\nDate & Time\nThursday, November 13, 2025\n1:20 PM - 4:20 PM Eastern (3 hours)\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Pastoor, PhD\nChief Technology and Product Officer, A2-AI\n\nAs CTPO of A2-Ai, Devin works with clients to deliver end-to-end solutions that support quantitative decision-making.

    "text": "Date & Time: November 12 at 10:00am, Eastern\n\n\nLLMs are powerful, flexible, easy-to-use… and often wrong. This is a dangerous combination, especially for data analysis and scientific research, where correctness and reproducibility are core requirements. Fortunately, it turns out that by carefully applying LLMs to narrower use cases, we can turn them into surprisingly reliable assistants that accelerate and enhance, rather than undermine, scientific work. This is not just theory—I’ll showcase working examples of seamlessly integrating LLMs into analytic workflows, helping data scientists build interactive, intelligent applications without needing to be web developers. You’ll see firsthand how keeping LLMs focused lets us leverage their “intelligence” in a way that’s practical, rigorous, and reproducible.\n\n\n\nJoe Cheng is the CTO and first employee at Posit, PBC (formerly known as RStudio), where he helped create the RStudio IDE, Shiny web framework, and Databot agent for exploratory data analysis."

    "text": "Me, Myself & Claude\nDate & Time: November 12 at 10:45 AM, Eastern\n\nAbstract\nMy AI journey started simple - better email replies and vacation planning. Then came the existential dread: “This thing writes decent R code and Shiny apps - am I about to be obsolete?” Followed quickly by the dependency anxiety: “Am I becoming lazy and losing my hard-earned R expertise to this crutch?”\nTurns out I was asking the wrong questions. The real question is: how do you use AI as a force multiplier that makes you a better R developer, not a dependent one?\nRunning a one-person analytics shop with real-life constraints, I’ve had to get creative about scaling my skills rather than my hours. AI assistance has let me take on more sophisticated R projects - complex Shiny applications, advanced package development, and solutions that previously would have meant turning down interesting work or working unsustainable hours. The breakthrough insight: AI doesn’t do the work for me - it frees up cognitive bandwidth so I can think more strategically, explore topics I never had time to study properly, and develop stronger opinions about what actually constitutes a good solution.\nThis talk walks through real examples from my practice where AI assistance helped me become more ruthlessly solutions-focused while actually strengthening my R intuition. You’ll see how spotting AI hallucinations and fixing error-prone generated code teaches you more about R patterns than traditional development ever did. We’ll also explore when AI tools do too much - over-abstracting solutions or creating unnecessary complexity - and how learning to recognize and redirect these moments actually sharpens your architectural decision-making.\n\n\nBio\nJasmine Daly is the Principal Consultant & Founder of Daly Analytics.

Repositories go stale, contributors move on, and documentation or testing never quite catches up. Meanwhile, tools such as roxygen2 and testthat as well as many others have become essential for the maintainability and distribution of R projects.\nIn this talk, we will see how large language models (LLMs) can accelerate the revival of under-maintained or legacy open source R projects. Using real examples, we will demonstrate how LLMs can: reverse-engineer undocumented functions into clear roxygen2 documentation blocks, scaffold testthat unit tests to validate behavior, integrate lintr and styler to enforce consistent code style and formatting, and suggest general code cleanups to improve readability and modularity.\nWe will walk through a practical, R-centric workflow that combines LLMs with modern package development tools to bring old code back to life. Whether you’re inheriting an archived package or want to breathe life into your own forgotten side project, this session will equip you with the tools and strategies to reduce technical debt and modernize open source code without starting from scratch.\n\n\nBio\nJonathan is a Data Scientist at Lightspeed Commerce in Toronto, Canada.

    "text": "mini007 - A Lightweight Framework for Multi-Agent Orchestration in R\nDate & Time: November 12 at 1:05 PM, Eastern\n\nAbstract\nThe growing sophistication of large language models has sparked interest in agent-based architectures capable of handling complex, multi-step reasoning processes. While R has robust support for working with LLMs via packages like ellmer, it lacks a lightweight, composable framework for coordinating multiple specialized agents. This is where mini007 comes in.\nmini007 provides a high-level interface for defining and orchestrating cooperative agents that can decompose and execute multi-faceted tasks. It builds on ellmer to manage language model objects but introduces two key abstractions: Agent and LeadAgent. Each agent operates with its own identity, instruction set, and memory, allowing it to specialize in a specific task. The LeadAgent takes a broader prompt, splits it into logical subtasks, assigns these to the appropriate agents, and then integrates their responses into a coherent output.\nThe result is a modular and extensible agent system that enables process-level intelligence, chaining together tasks like information retrieval, summarization, and translation. All of this is done in R, using familiar patterns and without requiring extensive infrastructure or external orchestration layers.\nThis presentation will walk through the design philosophy, core architecture, and real-world applications of mini007, including a live demonstration of multi-agent interaction with OpenAI-backed models. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to build and deploy their own agent workflows in R, as well as insight into how agentic thinking can enrich their LLM-based data science projects.\n\n\nBio\nMohamed el Fodil Ihaddaden is an analytics engineer at HDI Global SE.

While several hierarchies have been developed for codified data as medications and diagnoses (ICD, PheCode, RXNORM ingredients) which enable to regroup concepts into larger statistically significant groups, for natural language concepts however the task remains difficult. The Unified Medical Language System provides parent-child relationships between concepts, but it is challenging to identify at which level to regroup concepts and it is not a straightforward hierarchy. After multiple experiments trying to leverage graph theory properties, I finally took the route of a hybrid pipeline guided by the hierarchy of the codified data and leveraging BGE embeddings and the local LLM Llama 7B. In this workshop I will showcase the challenges in natural language ontology creation, how to constrain and control LLM behavior to manage securely the inherent hallucinations and safety-related issues, and why the LLM approaches enable new possibilities unreachable with previous methodologies.\n\n\nBio\nAs a Research Associate with Prof. Tianxi Cai, Thomas Charlon builds suicide risk models using survival analysis and NLP of electronic health records and scientific publications, to assist psychiatrists in identifying at-risk patients for the Center for Suicide Research Prevention project.

Utility functions support creation of training, validation, and test chips with associated masks/labels; a modified implementation of the unified focal loss framework; a custom DataSet subclass for geospatial data; assessment metrics; the ability to use a trained model to predict to large spatial extents to generate map output; utility functions to check and visualize components of the workflow; and methods for generating land surface parameters (LSPs) from digital terrain models. Models can be trained with chips saved to disk or chips created dynamically during the training process, which can simplify the workflow. The goal of this talk is to introduce geodl and its design philosophy, associated workflows, and documentation.

A few highlights:\nThe NumericEnsembles package will automatically build 40 models (23 individual and 17 ensembles), including regular learning and deep learning models. All the models which can be optimized (tuning, cross–validation) are done so automatically. There are many features, such as the ability to optimize which columns are used (there are eight optimization options, all done automatically based on the user preference).\nDeep learning models are critical to the success of the results in the NumericEnsembles package. This demonstration will show a live demo (in real time) doing an analysis of the Boston Housing data set. It will only require one line of code from the user, and will return results which beat all the top scores in Kaggle competitions going back 20 years. The entire process will take about ten seconds to set up from scratch, and less than one minute to run. This will all be done live in real time. The talk will highlight how the deep learning models get the best results from either the individual or ensemble results in the NumericEnsembles package.\nSecond, the ClassificationEnsembles package also relies on deep learning models. Similar to the first example, I’ll show how the ClassificationEnsembles package will get a score of 100% accuracy on the Dry Beans data set, with the help of deep learning classification methods. This will only take a few seconds to set up, and about one minute to run. This is all done completely automatically, and the value of deep learning models in ClassificationEnsembles will be highlighted.\nThird, the LogisticEnsembles package uses deep learning methods to get best results. It is similar to the previous two examples as it builds both individual and ensembles of models, using both regular learning and deep learning, all done automatically. We will look at the Pima Indians data set, and one of the top scoring results is the BayesRNN model. This will all be done automatically, take only seconds to set up, about a minute to run, and achieve results that beat all previously published results.\n\n\nBio\nRuss Conte has done a wide range of things in life.

    "text": "CancerClarity app: Enhancing cancer data visualization with AI-generated narratives\nDate & Time: November 13 at 1:30 PM, Eastern\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Community cancer centers face challenges in accessing cancer data and communicating health information to patients and community members due to limited tools and resources. The CancerClarity app, recognized at the 2023 Catchment Area Data Conference Hackathon, addresses this need by integrating data visualization with Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven narrative generation. Converting quantitative cancer statistics to narrative descriptions using large language models (LLMs) may help cancer centers communicate complex cancer data more effectively to diverse stakeholders.\nMethods: The CancerClarity app employs LLM prompting within the R Shiny web framework, sourcing data from Cancer InFocus. It offers users an interactive exploration of cancer incidence, mortality, and health determinants across U.S. counties.\nResults: The CancerClarity app integrates LLM via its application programming interface (API) for real-time, linguistically tailored narratives, making cancer data accessible to a broad audience. The app offers cancer centers a cost-effective solution to swiftly identify their catchment areas and assess the cancer burden within the populations they serve.\nDiscussion: By enhancing public health decision-making through AI-driven narratives, the app underscores the critical role of effective communication in public health. Future enhancements include the integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved AI responses and evidence-based public health guidance.\n\n\nBio\nMuñoz has a passion for reducing cancer and disease by applying innovative technologies like generative AI in the United States and his native Colombia.\nHe’s always willing to lend a hand and a smile whenever needed.\nMuñoz offers plenty of smiles and support for data science and epidemiology as a senior-level statistician at the Institute for Health Promotion Research (IHPR) at UT Health San Antonio.\nAt the IHPR, Muñoz assists in developing research, conducting analyses, identifying and using available methodologies and databases, and preparing reports.

    "text": "R+AI: Use RAG from your database to gain insights into the R Consortium\nDate & Time: November 13 at 2:05 PM, Eastern\n\nAbstract\nThe R Consortium blogs contain a rich set of content about R, the R Community, and R Consortium activities. You could read each blog yourself, or you could ask natural language questions using Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using this content as a basis. RAG combines vector search with generative AI – enabling more relevant and up-to-date responses from your large language model (LLM).\nIn this session, we highlight using an R interface to answers natural language questions using R Consortium blog content. Using RStudio, we’ll take you through a series of R functions showing you how to easily create a vector index and invoke RAG-related functionality from Oracle Autonomous Database, switching between LLMs and using external and database-internal transformers. Users can try this for themselves using a free LiveLabs environment, which we’ll highlight during the session.\n\n\nBio - Mark Hornick\nMark Hornick is the senior director of product management for Oracle Machine Learning and Select AI.
