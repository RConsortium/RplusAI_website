## Keynote: Keeping LLMs in Their Lane: Focused AI for Data Science and Research

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 10:00am, Eastern

### Abstract

LLMs are powerful, flexible, easy-to-use... and often wrong. This is a dangerous combination, especially for data analysis and scientific research, where correctness and reproducibility are core requirements. Fortunately, it turns out that by carefully applying LLMs to narrower use cases, we can turn them into surprisingly reliable assistants that accelerate and enhance, rather than undermine, scientific work. This is not just theory—I'll showcase working examples of seamlessly integrating LLMs into analytic workflows, helping data scientists build interactive, intelligent applications without needing to be web developers. You'll see firsthand how keeping LLMs focused lets us leverage their "intelligence" in a way that's practical, rigorous, and reproducible.

## Me, Myself & Claude

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 10:45 AM, Eastern

### Abstract

My AI journey started simple - better email replies and vacation planning. Then came the existential dread: "This thing writes decent R code and Shiny apps - am I about to be obsolete?" Followed quickly by the dependency anxiety: "Am I becoming lazy and losing my hard-earned R expertise to this crutch?"

Turns out I was asking the wrong questions. The real question is: how do you use AI as a force multiplier that makes you a better R developer, not a dependent one?

Running a one-person analytics shop with real-life constraints, I've had to get creative about scaling my skills rather than my hours. AI assistance has let me take on more sophisticated R projects - complex Shiny applications, advanced package development, and solutions that previously would have meant turning down interesting work or working unsustainable hours. The breakthrough insight: AI doesn't do the work for me - it frees up cognitive bandwidth so I can think more strategically, explore topics I never had time to study properly, and develop stronger opinions about what actually constitutes a good solution.

This talk walks through real examples from my practice where AI assistance helped me become more ruthlessly solutions-focused while actually strengthening my R intuition. You'll see how spotting AI hallucinations and fixing error-prone generated code teaches you more about R patterns than traditional development ever did. We'll also explore when AI tools do too much - over-abstracting solutions or creating unnecessary complexity - and how learning to recognize and redirect these moments actually sharpens your architectural decision-making.

## Reviving Forgotten Code with LLMs

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 11:20 AM, Eastern

### Abstract

Open source R projects are the backbone of our community, but too often, valuable code is left behind. Repositories go stale, contributors move on, and documentation or testing never quite catches up. Meanwhile, tools such as roxygen2 and testthat as well as many others have become essential for the maintainability and distribution of R projects.

In this talk, we will see how large language models (LLMs) can accelerate the revival of under-maintained or legacy open source R projects. Using real examples, we will demonstrate how LLMs can: reverse-engineer undocumented functions into clear roxygen2 documentation blocks, scaffold testthat unit tests to validate behavior, integrate lintr and styler to enforce consistent code style and formatting, and suggest general code cleanups to improve readability and modularity.

We will walk through a practical, R-centric workflow that combines LLMs with modern package development tools to bring old code back to life. Whether you're inheriting an archived package or want to breathe life into your own forgotten side project, this session will equip you with the tools and strategies to reduce technical debt and modernize open source code without starting from scratch.

## Tools for LLMs and Humans who use R

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 11:55 AM, Eastern

### Abstract

The btw package bridges the gap between R environments and large language models (LLMs), providing a collection of tools that supercharge LLMs for R tasks.

At the core of btw are tools to describe data frames, functions, package documentation, help pages, file paths, and environment objects, automatically generating structured descriptions that provide essential context to LLMs. btw goes beyond context-tools to include additional tools that are useful when building chat interfaces or LLM-powered agents in R with ellmer.

This presentation will demonstrate practical workflows for R users seeking to leverage AI assistance more effectively, showcasing how btw eliminates the friction of providing computational context to LLMs and enables more productive human-AI collaboration in data science and statistical computing workflows.

## Building a Better R AI Assistant: A Multi-Agent Approach

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 12:30 PM, Eastern

### Abstract

Public large language models (LLMs) offer a glimpse of AI-powered assistance for R, but their utility is often limited to the most popular packages, constrained by knowledge cutoff date, and does not cover private, internal packages. How do we provide expert-level support for the entire R ecosystem, including specialized libraries and brand-new releases? This talk introduces our solution: a scalable, multi-agent system where expert agents are dynamically created on-demand for each of R's 22,000+ packages. By building these agents from the most current documentation, we deliver specialized, trustworthy support where public models fail.

This session dives into the architectural patterns that make our multi-agent system work. Built in Python using the LangGraph framework, I'll focus on the key design decisions, sharing the practical techniques used to give agents the right context to write, debug, and explain R code. I will also cover our approach to dynamically creating and managing these specialized agents. The entire system is deployed as a flexible backend service, allowing us to support multiple types of clients including an interactive chat, an MCP server, and a REST API.

Whether you're building developer copilots or specialized technical assistants, this talk offers a framework for creating AI systems that are not just functional, but also robust, maintainable, and trustworthy at scale.

## mini007 - A Lightweight Framework for Multi-Agent Orchestration in R

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 1:05 PM, Eastern

### Abstract

The growing sophistication of large language models has sparked interest in agent-based architectures capable of handling complex, multi-step reasoning processes. While R has robust support for working with LLMs via packages like ellmer, it lacks a lightweight, composable framework for coordinating multiple specialized agents. This is where mini007 comes in.

mini007 provides a high-level interface for defining and orchestrating cooperative agents that can decompose and execute multi-faceted tasks. It builds on ellmer to manage language model objects but introduces two key abstractions: Agent and LeadAgent. Each agent operates with its own identity, instruction set, and memory, allowing it to specialize in a specific task. The LeadAgent takes a broader prompt, splits it into logical subtasks, assigns these to the appropriate agents, and then integrates their responses into a coherent output.

The result is a modular and extensible agent system that enables process-level intelligence, chaining together tasks like information retrieval, summarization, and translation. All of this is done in R, using familiar patterns and without requiring extensive infrastructure or external orchestration layers.

This presentation will walk through the design philosophy, core architecture, and real-world applications of mini007, including a live demonstration of multi-agent interaction with OpenAI-backed models. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to build and deploy their own agent workflows in R, as well as insight into how agentic thinking can enrich their LLM-based data science projects.

## Analyzing LLM Evaluations

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 1:40 PM, Eastern

### Abstract

Frameworks exist for automating the evaluations of LLMs so that queries can be executed and assessed over many experimental factors: LLM models, prompts, replicates, etc. The resulting designs are often factorial in nature but can have a variety of hierarchical structures, such as replicates within queries, scores within raters, and so on.

This talk describes how experimental results can be analyzed and reported for a variety of designs and outcome types (percentage correct, correct/incorrect, ordinal scales, etc.). It also shows how off-the-shelf tools for Frequentist and Bayesian inferential analysis can be utilized. The methods are illustrated with an example evaluation experiment.

## Biomedical ontology dictionary creation with embeddings and local LLMs

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 2:15 PM, Eastern

### Abstract

Analysis of natural language concepts in the biomedical field remains a challenge, such as the analysis of clinicians' narrative notes in electronic health records. While several hierarchies have been developed for codified data as medications and diagnoses (ICD, PheCode, RXNORM ingredients) which enable to regroup concepts into larger statistically significant groups, for natural language concepts however the task remains difficult. The Unified Medical Language System provides parent-child relationships between concepts, but it is challenging to identify at which level to regroup concepts and it is not a straightforward hierarchy. After multiple experiments trying to leverage graph theory properties, I finally took the route of a hybrid pipeline guided by the hierarchy of the codified data and leveraging BGE embeddings and the local LLM Llama 7B. In this workshop I will showcase the challenges in natural language ontology creation, how to constrain and control LLM behavior to manage securely the inherent hallucinations and safety-related issues, and why the LLM approaches enable new possibilities unreachable with previous methodologies.

## Brand your docs, apps, and ggplots using LLMs

**Date & Time:** November 12 at 3:25 PM, Eastern

### Abstract

A single _brand.yml file enables you to consistently use company branding across all of your projects. However, it takes a significant amount of time to develop a _brand.yml file and {ggplot2} scales & themes that follow company branding. In this talk, I'll introduce you to the createBranding shiny app that enables you to rapidly create and iterate over _brand.yml and {ggplot2} goodies using Large Language Models (LLMs). The app takes in the screenshot(s) of company branding guidelines and user instructions, provides them to the Google Gemini model via {ellmer}, and generates an editable _brand.yml file. Subsequently, the app creates a colour palette and {ggplot2} scales & theme based on the saved _brand.yml file. This workflow is possible due to the structured output feature of {ellmer}.

## Introducing geodl: An R package for geospatial semantic segmentation using torch, terra, and luz

**Date & Time:** November 13 at 10:00 AM, Eastern

### Abstract

The R package geodl was released in August 2024 to build upon the torch, terra, and luz packages to support graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated geospatial deep learning semantic segmentation (i.e., pixel-level classification) in the R language and data science environment without the need to install a Python/PyTorch environment. geodl offers four convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures: a generic and customizable UNet architecture; a UNet architecture with a MobileNetv2 encoder, UNet3+, and HRNet. Utility functions support creation of training, validation, and test chips with associated masks/labels; a modified implementation of the unified focal loss framework; a custom DataSet subclass for geospatial data; assessment metrics; the ability to use a trained model to predict to large spatial extents to generate map output; utility functions to check and visualize components of the workflow; and methods for generating land surface parameters (LSPs) from digital terrain models. Models can be trained with chips saved to disk or chips created dynamically during the training process, which can simplify the workflow. The goal of this talk is to introduce geodl and its design philosophy, associated workflows, and documentation. Future development goals will be described, such as incorporating transformer-based architectures and autoencoders, the ability to undertake regression tasks, and means to further customize the training process. Ultimately, we are hoping to encourage the use of the package and attract additional contributors to help further build a geospatial deep learning ecosystem in the R language.

## How deep learning helps build results that beat prior records, can be set up in seconds while taking minimal time to run, and are very easy to use

**Date & Time:** November 13 at 10:35 AM, Eastern

### Abstract

This talk will highlight four packages I posted on CRAN, initially in April, 2025, with subsequent improvements posted as improvements are completed. A few highlights:

The NumericEnsembles package will automatically build 40 models (23 individual and 17 ensembles), including regular learning and deep learning models. All the models which can be optimized (tuning, cross–validation) are done so automatically. There are many features, such as the ability to optimize which columns are used (there are eight optimization options, all done automatically based on the user preference).

Deep learning models are critical to the success of the results in the NumericEnsembles package. This demonstration will show a live demo (in real time) doing an analysis of the Boston Housing data set. It will only require one line of code from the user, and will return results which beat all the top scores in Kaggle competitions going back 20 years. The entire process will take about ten seconds to set up from scratch, and less than one minute to run. This will all be done live in real time. The talk will highlight how the deep learning models get the best results from either the individual or ensemble results in the NumericEnsembles package.

Second, the ClassificationEnsembles package also relies on deep learning models. Similar to the first example, I'll show how the ClassificationEnsembles package will get a score of 100% accuracy on the Dry Beans data set, with the help of deep learning classification methods. This will only take a few seconds to set up, and about one minute to run. This is all done completely automatically, and the value of deep learning models in ClassificationEnsembles will be highlighted.

Third, the LogisticEnsembles package uses deep learning methods to get best results. It is similar to the previous two examples as it builds both individual and ensembles of models, using both regular learning and deep learning, all done automatically. We will look at the Pima Indians data set, and one of the top scoring results is the BayesRNN model. This will all be done automatically, take only seconds to set up, about a minute to run, and achieve results that beat all previously published results.

### Bio

Russ Conte has done a wide range of things in life. A few (of many) include earning the #1 spot at his university in an annual mathematics competition (twice), earning a mathematics degree at the same time as a music degree, working as a professional counselor for ten years, working in (and sometime managing) multi-million dollar businesses for a multi-billion dollar global company, President of the Chicago Apple User Group, musician on a wide range of instruments, and a local leader for Amnesty International.

Russ developed four R packages that use AI and ensembles to automatically give results that consistently beat previous results for a given data set. His next chapter in life will be sharing these results with the world. These packages are his answer to a simple question: If you could build your dream data science solution, what would it be? You'll see his answer in his talk.

## Tracking the Evolution of R and Python Tools for GenAI: State of the Ecosystem & Lessons from Building in Both

**Date & Time:** November 13 at 11:45 AM, Eastern

### Abstract

R and Python communities have approached GenAI from different starting points, converging rapidly around similar ideas: calling models safely, structuring outputs, orchestrating tools/agents, and evaluating quality at scale. In this talk we share observations from building LLM-enabled applications and MCP-style integrations in both languages, focusing on developer experience in both ecosystems. Rather than a tour of specific packages, we outline portable patterns: request/response contracts, tool/function design, evaluation loops, that work in R-first, Python-first, or mixed stacks. We'll also touch on how MCP concepts emerged in practice in Python ecosystems and how similar workflows are taking shape for R users. Attendees will leave with a language-agnostic blueprint and checklist for shipping LLM apps, adaptable interop patterns, and a short, curated set of resources.

## R+AI: Use RAG from your database to gain insights into the R Consortium

**Date & Time:** November 13 at 2:05 PM, Eastern

### Abstract

The R Consortium blogs contain a rich set of content about R, the R Community, and R Consortium activities. You could read each blog yourself, or you could ask natural language questions using Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using this content as a basis. RAG combines vector search with generative AI – enabling more relevant and up-to-date responses from your large language model (LLM).

In this session, we highlight using an R interface to answers natural language questions using R Consortium blog content. Using RStudio, we'll take you through a series of R functions showing you how to easily create a vector index and invoke RAG-related functionality from Oracle Autonomous Database, switching between LLMs and using external and database-internal transformers. Users can try this for themselves using a free LiveLabs environment, which we'll highlight during the session.
