#### Abstract

LLMs are powerful, flexible, easy-to-use... and often wrong. This is a dangerous combination, especially for data analysis and scientific research, where correctness and reproducibility are core requirements. Fortunately, it turns out that by carefully applying LLMs to narrower use cases, we can turn them into surprisingly reliable assistants that accelerate and enhance, rather than undermine, scientific work. This is not just theory—I'll showcase working examples of seamlessly integrating LLMs into analytic workflows, helping data scientists build interactive, intelligent applications without needing to be web developers. You'll see firsthand how keeping LLMs focused lets us leverage their "intelligence" in a way that's practical, rigorous, and reproducible.
